# Sunscreen
Sunscreen is a (very) WIP GUI library, built with ultimate platform compatability in mind. It removes the limitations of chest GUIs, meaning you can place any element anywhere! Input is also ahead of chest GUIs, with inputs ranging from clicking and hovering to text input, anywhere on the screen!

![Showcase of the library](./assets/image/showcase-gif.gif)

## Features
- Native support for text input
- Hover and click animations
- Client sided cursor
- FOV-Locking
- Full screen menu capability
- Replace menus from any plugin!
- Ingame editor (WIP)

## Credits and Appreciation
I'd like to offer special thanks to the following people for either providing public resources or helping significantly in any way.
- `willemdev (@OmeWillem)` for helping with the map encoding system/shader and immense amounts of support.
- `retrooper (@retrooper)` for creating and providing [packetevents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) and thus saving lots of compatibility worries.
- `pianoman911 & booky10 (@pianoman911, @booky10)` for the inspiration for my own BufferedImage alternative (BufferedColorSpace) through their code in [MapEngine](https://github.com/MinceraftMC/MapEngine)
